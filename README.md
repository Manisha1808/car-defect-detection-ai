AI Vehicle Damage Detection System 🚗🔍

A full-stack AI application that detects vehicle defects from uploaded images and generates an automated inspection report. The system uses a YOLO-based object detection model integrated with a Flask backend and a React frontend dashboard.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates how computer vision can be used for automated vehicle inspection. Users can upload an image of a vehicle, and the system detects possible defects using an object detection model. The results are displayed visually along with a structured inspection report including defect type, confidence score, and severity classification.

Features

Upload vehicle images for inspection

AI-based defect detection using a YOLO model

Visualization of detected defects on the image

Inspection report with defect type and confidence score

Severity classification (High / Medium / Low)

Full-stack integration with Flask and React

Clean and interactive user interface

How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Manisha1808/car-defect-detection-ai.git
cd car-defect-detection-ai
2️⃣ Setup backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py

Backend runs on:

http://localhost:5000
3️⃣ Run frontend
cd frontend/car-defect-frontend
npm install
npm start

Frontend runs on:

http://localhost:3000
Example Output

The system produces:

detected defect regions on the vehicle image

confidence scores for each detection

an AI inspection report summarizing the results

(Add screenshots here in your repo for better presentation.)

Future Improvements

Add PDF export for inspection reports

Improve defect classification categories

Deploy full system to cloud

Add model performance metrics dashboard
